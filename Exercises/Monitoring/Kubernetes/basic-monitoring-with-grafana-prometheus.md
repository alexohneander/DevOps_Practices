# Basic Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

To monitor your cluster completely, the two tools Prometheus and Grafana helps you.
Prometheus reads the data of your endpoints and with Grafana would evaluate and monitor them.

### Short explanation

#### Grafana
Grafana is a complete observability stack that allows you to monitor and analyze metrics, logs and traces. It allows you to query, visualize, alert on and understand your data no matter where it is stored. Create, explore, and share beautiful dashboards with your team and foster a data driven culture.

#### Prometheus
Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud. Since its inception in 2012, many companies and organizations have adopted Prometheus, and the project has a very active developer and user community. It is now a standalone open source project and maintained independently of any company. To emphasize this, and to clarify the project's governance structure, Prometheus joined the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in 2016 as the second hosted project, after Kubernetes.

Prometheus collects and stores its metrics as time series data, i.e. metrics information is stored with the timestamp at which it was recorded, alongside optional key-value pairs called labels.
